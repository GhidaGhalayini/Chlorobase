# Chlorobase

The "ChloroBase Report" outlines a comprehensive planting care guidance system designed to educate users about various plants while facilitating the purchase of gardening tools and supplies. The project aims to bridge the knowledge gap in the agriculture community by providing a user-friendly database that offers detailed information on plant cultivation, including soil types, watering schedules, and pest management strategies. The database design includes an extensive Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram featuring entities such as customers, plants, measurements, colors, conditions, habitats, and items. It also includes relationships between these entities, ranging from one-to-one to many-to-many. The report details the implementation of SQL queries to manage and retrieve data efficiently and discusses the development of a website prototype that allows users to access plant data, purchase equipment, and seek expert advice. Ultimately, ChloroBase aims to create a vibrant community of gardening enthusiasts and experts, fostering knowledge-sharing and collaboration.
